= Spring Cloud Spinnaker

Spring Cloud Spinnaker is a Spring Boot web application used to deploy all the parts of http://spinnaker.io[Spinnaker]
to a pre-selected space in PCF.

== Running Spring Cloud Spinnaker

To run the app locally on your machine, you have to follow a few steps.

Requirements:

* Either a Mac or Unix based system. (Building the Spinnaker components on Windows won't work, and Cygwin has yet to be tested)
* Java 8 SDK
* git

=== Building Spinnaker

Before you can run this application, you have to build Spinnaker's modules.

1. Clone this repository
1. Run `git submodule init`
1. Run `git submodule update`
1. Run `./build_spinnaker.sh`
+
WARNING: Do NOT interrupt `build_spinnaker.sh` in mid process. Due to the nature of Spinnaker's nebula gradle plugin, the
components cannot be built inside a git submodule. The script temporarily moves each module into /tmp, builds it, then
moves it back. Any interruptions would require reseting the state of your cloned repository.

=== Targeting your deployment environment

This app uses the Spring Cloud Deployer for Cloud Foundry library. To support it, you need to create a key file:

.`src/main/resources/application-dev.yml`
[source]
----
spring:
  cloud:
    deployer:
      cloudfoundry:
        username: <your username>
        password: <your password>
        organization: <your CF org>
        space: <your CF space>
        apiEndpoint: <your API endpoint>
        domain: <default domain of your CF org>
        skipSslValidation: true
----

NOTE: Don't worry! `application-dev.yml` is listed as a file to NOT put under source control inside `.gitignore`.

With `src/main/resources/application-dev.yml` in place, you are now ready to run Spring Cloud Spinnaker.

----
SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE=dev ./mvnw clean spring-boot:run
----

Visit localhost:8080 and login using the credentials specified in application.yml.

== Deploying Spinnaker

The app is designed to mimic a PCF tile. There is a tab for settings, and another for deploying and undeploying the modules.

Requirements:

* Create a Redis service in your target PCF space

=== Settings

.Settings

| Name of the Redis service you created

| Account Name
| Account name for Spinnaker to use when logging into PCF

| Account Password
| Account password for Spinnaker to use when logging into PCF

| Repository Name/Access Code
| If you are pulling deployment artifacts from an http-based repository, put your username. If s3, put your access code

NOTE: If your repository isn't secured, leave blank

| Repository Password/Secret Code
| If you are pulling deployment artifacts from an http-based repository, put your password. If s3, put your secret code

With your settings filled in, click on the Status tab.

=== Deploying

On the Status tab, you have the ability to check each module, or deal with them all.

1. Click on *Deploy All*.
1. Sit back and sip on a cup of coffee. This will take some time.

== Next Steps

After getting Spinnaker up and running, you should be able to access deck, the UI for Spinnaker, by visiting
