= Spring Cloud Spinnaker

Spring Cloud Spinnaker is a Spring Boot web application used to deploy all the parts of http://spinnaker.io[Spinnaker]
to a pre-selected space in PCF.

== Running Spring Cloud Spinnaker

To run the app locally on your machine, you have to follow a few steps.

Requirements:

* Either a Mac or Unix based system. (Building the Spinnaker components on Windows won't work, and Cygwin has yet to be tested)
* Java 8 SDK
* git

=== Building Spinnaker

Before you can run this application, you have to build Spinnaker's modules.

1. Clone this repository
1. Run `git submodule init`
1. Run `git submodule update`
1. Run `./build_spinnaker.sh`
+
WARNING: Do NOT interrupt `build_spinnaker.sh` in mid process. Due to the nature of Spinnaker's nebula gradle plugin, the
components cannot be built inside a git submodule. The script temporarily moves each module into /tmp, builds it, then
moves it back. Any interruptions would require reseting the state of your cloned repository.
+
1. Run `./mvnw clean package`
1. Run `cf push spinnaker-deployer -p target/spring-cloud-spinnaker-<version>.jar`

Now you can point your browser at the deployment site of the Spinnaker Deployer, fill outs its settings, and install Spinnaker anywhere!

== Deploying Spinnaker

The app is designed to mimic a PCF tile. There is a tab for settings, and another for deploying and undeploying the modules.

Requirements:

* Create a Redis service in your target PCF space
